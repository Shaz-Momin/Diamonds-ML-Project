## Overview of the Dataset

This dataset records the features of many different diamonds which allows us to determine the price of the diamond.

Total number of records: 54K

## 10 features of the Dataset:
- Carat
- Categorical data:
  - cut
  - color
  - clarity
- Depth: height in mm (from the bottom to the table)
- Table: flat top surface of the diamond
- Fractures: natural inclusions or imperfections visible to the naked eye
  - x-fracture
  - y-fracture
  - z-fracture
- Price

### What can we try to predict in this dataset? 

The main thing we would like to predict would be the price of a diamond based on its physical features. This could be done either in price ranges or the actual price. 

### Is this a labeled dataset, appropriate for a supervised learning classification or regression problem?

This dataset includes the price for each diamond which will give us a regression problem to predict the price of an unseen diamond.
